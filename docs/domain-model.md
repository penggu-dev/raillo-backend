## Entity Relationships

```
Train → TrainCar (1:N) → Seat (1:N)
TrainSchedule → ScheduleStop (1:N) → Station (N:1)
Booking → SeatBooking (1:N) → Seat
Booking → Ticket (1:N)
Order → OrderBooking (1:N) → OrderSeatBooking (1:N)
Order → Payment (1:1)
Member → Booking (1:N)
Member → Order (1:N)
```

## Booking Flow

1. **열차 검색** — Query TrainSchedule + ScheduleStop
2. **좌석 선택** — Create Reservation + PendingSeatBooking (Redis, TTL 10min)
3. **결제 준비** — Convert to Order (PENDING) + OrderBooking + OrderSeatBooking, create Payment (PENDING)
4. **결제 승인** — Toss Payments approval → Payment (PAID), Order (ORDERED)
5. **예매 확정** — Convert to Booking + SeatBooking, issue Tickets, delete Reservation from Redis

## Domain Terminology (Korean)

- **예약** = Reservation (temporary, before payment)
- **예매** = Booking (confirmed, after payment)
- **승차권** = Ticket (issued document)
- **객차** = TrainCar
- **좌석** = Seat
- **정차역** = ScheduleStop
